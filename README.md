# Blog_API
This is a RESTful API that allows us to store and retrieve the blog's data.

This is part of the three parts that make up the Blog App.

# Content Management System
This is the second part, a React front-end, which gives the admin sole authorization to all CRUD actions on posts.
The source code can be found at [Blog_Admin](https://github.com/kelshuka/Blog_Admin.git).

# Client
This is the users front-end, built with React. Users can perform CRUD on their respective comments. The source code can be found at [Blog_Users](https://github.com/kelshuka/Blog_Users.git)
